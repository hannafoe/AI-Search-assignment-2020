# AI-Search-assignment-2020
This is the assignment for the sub-module AI Search of the module Artificial Intelligence at Durham University in 2020. In this assignment I have implemented the Ant-Colony-Optimisation and the Particle-Swarm-Optimisation. The following explains the assignment. For more information on the assignment please refer to  AISearchAssignment2020-21.pdf.
## Files
- "Algorithms I do not need" is a file which contains first versions of the implementation.
- "city-files" contains the set of nodes the Algorithms were tested on.
- "lzhc88" is the final submission file

## Overview
You are to implement two different algorithms (call them AlgA and AlgB) in Python to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Your algorithms can be drawn from those we cover in the lectures but you might also implement other algorithms you have devised or discovered for yourself.
Your implementations should seek to obtain the best TSP tours that you can, given 10 collections of cities and their city-to-city distances that I will supply to you. You will need to hand in the following items:
- between 2 and 4 correct Python programs comprising of:
  - at least a basic implementation of each of your chosen algorithms, necessarily named AlgAbasic.py and AlgBbasic.py;
and
  - possibly an enhanced implementation of each of your chosen algorithms, necessarily named AlgAenhanced.py and AlgBenhanced.py
(moreover, all implementations need to be precisely formatted and based around skeleton code that I will supply to you; more later)
- for each of the two chosen algorithms that you implement, 10 tours, one for each city set that I give you, detailing the best tours you have found with any implementation of that algorithm, basic or enhanced, over the course of the assignment (moreover, each tour needs to be in a specically named and formatted tour file; more later); so this amounts to 20 tour files
- a one-page proforma (a pdf document) that briefly describes the enhancements you have made in your enhanced implementations, in comparison to the basic implementations.
